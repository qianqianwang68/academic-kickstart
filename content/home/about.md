# About

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Cornell University, advised by [Noah Snavely](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/) and [Bharath Hariharan](http://home.bharathh.info/). I received my bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University. My research interests lie in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
